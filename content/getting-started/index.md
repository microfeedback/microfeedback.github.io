Welcome to the MicroFeedback docs.

## What is MicroFeedback?

MicroFeedback is a collection of microservices and UI components for
collecting user feedback.

Once you have a MicroFeedback backend deployed and a UI component on your site, user feedback
will be posted to your issue tracker (e.g., on GitHub or in JIRA).

MicroFeedback aims to provide a **no-cost, easily-deployable, and open
source solution** for collecting feedback about your website or app.

## What next?

- If you're just starting out, check out the [Core concepts](/getting-started/core-concepts) page to learn about the two components
of the MicroFeedback project: *Backends* and *UI Components*.
- If you're looking for documentation on a specific backend, see the
[Backends](/backends/) page.
- If you need to add a feedback button to your site, see [microfeedback-button](/ui-components/microfeedback-button).
